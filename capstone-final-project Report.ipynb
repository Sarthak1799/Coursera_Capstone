Introduction/Business Problem </h2>\n\n<p> London and Paris are quite the popular tourist and vacation destinations for people all around the world. They are diverse and multicultural and offer a wide variety of experiences that is widely sought after. We try to group the neighbourhoods of London and Paris respectively and draw insights to what they look like now. These cities are majestic to say the least. They have been the hub of several great civilisations.</p>\n\n<p> The aim is to help tourists choose their destinations depending on the experiences that the neighbourhoods have to offer and what they would want to have. This also helps people make decisions if they are thinking about migrating to London or Paris or even if they want to relocate neighbourhoods within the city. Our findings will help stakeholders make informed decisions and address any concerns they have including the different kinds of cuisines, provision stores and what the city has to offer.

We want to enable them to make informed decision and save both money and time,not to mention a lot of effort as well. </p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2> 2. Data Description </h2>\n\n<p> We require geographical location data for both London and Paris. Postal codes in each city serve as a starting point. Using Postal codes we use can find out the neighborhoods, boroughs, venues and their most popular venue categories. </p>\n\n<p> For London Data, We scrape our data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London\n\nThis wikipedia page has information about all the neighbourhoods, we limit it to London.\n<ul>\n    <li>borough : Name of Neighbourhood</li>\n    <li>town : Name of borough</li>\n    <li>post_code : Postal codes for London.</li>\n</ul>    \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p> For Paris Data, We leverage JSON data available at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/e88c6fda-1d09-42a0-a069-606d3259114e\n\nThe JSON file has data about all the neighbourhoods in France, we limit it to Paris.\n<ul>\n    <li>postal_code : Postal codes for France</li>\n    <li>nom_comm : Name of Neighbourhoods in France</li>\n    <li>nom_dept : Name of the boroughs, equivalent to towns in France</li>\n    <li>geo_point_2d : Tuple containing the latitude and longitude of the Neighbourhoods.</li>\n    </ul>\n</p>\n\n\n<p> We can further leverage Foursquare API to gain additional data, The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. We set the radius to 500m. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n<ul>\n    <li>Neighbourhood : Name of the Neighbourhood</li>\n    <li>Neighbourhood Latitude : Latitude of the Neighbourhood</li>\n    <li>Neighbourhood Longitude : Longitude of the Neighbourhood</li>\n    <li>Venue : Name of the Venue</li>\n    <li>Venue Latitude : Latitude of Venue</li>\n    <li>Venue Longitude : Longitude of Venue</li>\n    <li>Venue Category : Category of Venue</li>\n    </ul>\n</p>\n\n\n<p> This data should suffice and could very well provide us with enough resources to make a detailed report. </p>"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.9","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
